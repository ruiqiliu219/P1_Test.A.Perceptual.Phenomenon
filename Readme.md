###Variables
In Stroop task, independent variable is a list of words with either a congruent words condition or an incongruent words condition. Dependent variable is the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists.

###Hypothesis and Statistics Tool
A reasonable hypothesis can be it usually takes shorter time to name a congruent word list than an incongruent word list.

That is
Null Hypothesis: μ.Congruent equals to μ.Incongruent
Alternative Hypotheis : : μ.Congruent does not euql to μIncongruent
 
Since results in this test are generated by one individual in two different conditions, we should apply dependent t-test in the following statistical analysis.

###Descriptive Statistics
######Central tendency statistics
|      | Congruent        | Incongruent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| mean   | 14.05| 22.02 |
| median      | 14.36      |   21.02|
| mode  | 12.08     |    19.28 |

######Variance
 |      | Congruent        | Incongruent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|    | 12.67| 23.01 |

###Distribution of Sample

We can see that both incongruent data and congruent data are right skewed and incongruent data spread on the right of congruent data.
