##Report
###Variables
In Stroop task, independent variable is a list of words with either a congruent words condition or an incongruent words condition. Dependent variable is the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists.

###Hypothesis and Statistics Tool
A reasonable hypothesis can be it usually takes shorter time to name a congruent word list than an incongruent word list.

That is
Null Hypothesis: μ.Congruent equals to μ.Incongruent
Alternative Hypotheis : : μ.Congruent does not euql to μIncongruent
 
Since results in this test are generated by one individual in two different conditions, we should apply dependent t-test in the following statistical analysis.

###Descriptive Statistics
######Central tendency statistics
|        | Congruent| Incongruent|
| ------ |-----------| ----------|
| mean   | 14.05     | 22.02     |
| median | 14.36     |   21.02   |
| mode   | 12.08     |    19.28  |

######Variablity
|      | Congruent        | Incongruent  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| variance | 12.67| 23.01 |
|standard deviation|3.56|4.80|  

###Distribution of Sample

We can see that both incongruent data and congruent data are right skewed and incongruent data spread on the right of congruent data.

###Statistical Test 
A two sided α = 5% dependent t-test was performed and the results are provided below.
 
t –value = -8.02 with 23 degree of freedom and the associated  p-value is 4.103e-08. The 95% confident interval for the mean difference is (-10.02 to -5.91)
 
Since the p-value is so small, we can successfully reject the null hypothesis. We can 95% confident to say that the average time it takes to finish a congruent word list test is shorter than the average time to finish an incongruent one and 95% of time the difference is between 5.91 to 10.02 seconds.
 
The result matches my expectation.
 
 
###Discussion
I think it is because human brain processes words faster than processes color.

To prove my point, we can present participants’ with two equally-sized lists: one is an incongruent word list which is the same as the original Stroop task, the other one is also an incongruent word list but the words are displayed in a different language that none of participants’ understand(for example, Mandarin).  The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. We measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists.

To illustrate:

List 1

List 2

I expect the mean time of the second group is shorter than the first group.
